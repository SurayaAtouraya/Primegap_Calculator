# Primegap Calculator

A program that once compiled creates an executable file, primegap. What primegap does is calculate the largest gap in consecutive prime numbers using the GMP library.

Sample run:

    ./primegap

    Usage: ./primegap a b

    ./primegap 0 10
    Largest prime gap in [0, 10] is 2
    computed in 0.0e+00 seconds

    ./primegap 1 100
    Largest prime gap in [1, 100] is 8
    computed in 0.0e+00 seconds

    ./primegap 1 10000
    Largest prime gap in [1, 10000] is 36
    computed in 2.8e+02 seconds
